TO DO
- add in second branch for scrambled classified raster i.e. null
- change figures and add in side by side null comparison
- make median line full vertical on spec curves so it doesn't look like median of y axis
- make all figure text larger and clearer
- ensure legends to figures are better at explaining what is in them, in particular model beta results ones
- address the cold open into movement eco in the intro
- ensure preference or selection is used consistently
- ensure there are no sentences implying that replication == truth - but instead they should hint that replication is a way of detecting model differences or room for improvement?
